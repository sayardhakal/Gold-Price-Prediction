# Gold-Price-Prediction
In this project, I have build Gold Price Prediction using python machine learning. I have used Random Forest Regressor algorithms for model training. The dataset used in this project is taken from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/gold-price-data). Here, GLD is a target column . Overall steps done in this project are below:
1. data collection
2. pre-processing and data analysis
3. visualziation
4. train test split
5. model training
6. evaluation and prediction
7. building a predictive system
